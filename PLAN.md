# [Project Name]
ImageX (will change later)
## Objective:
To develop a multimodal AI system capable of analyzing various types of X-ray images (e.g., chest, brain, spine, hand) and automatically generating professional, high-quality radiology reports. The project will involve building a specialized Transformer model from scratch that bridges the gap between diverse visual data and specific medical language, creating an intelligent tool to assist radiologists.
## Tech Stack:
Languages: Python, HTML, JavaScript
Frameworks: PyTorch, Hugging Face tokenizers, Flask (or Django), React (or Vue.js)
Key Libraries: torchvision, Pillow, tqdm, pandas, NumPy
Infrastructure: Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab, SHELL (for training), Heroku/AWS/GCP (for deployment)
## Team Roles: 
Each mentee will take ownership of a specific X-ray domain (e.g., chest, brain, spine) and will be responsible for the entire project lifecycle within that domainâ€”from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
## Step Plan:
1.  Introduce core AI/ML concepts and set up the development environment. The team will decide on which X-ray domains each mentee will specialize in.
2.  Each mentee will build a complete data pipeline for their specific X-ray domain, including data acquisition, cleaning reports, and creating a custom Byte-Level BPE tokenizer for their medical language corpus.
3. The team will implement the multimodal Transformer model from scratch. Each mentee will then train an instance of this model on their specific dataset, integrating an appropriate image encoder (e.g., a pre-trained ResNet or Vision Transformer).
4. Evaluation & Refinement: Each mentee will analyze their model's performance and implement advanced inference strategies and fine-tuning to improve report quality within their domain.
5. The team will collaborate to build the website, integrate each of the domain-specific models into the back-end, and deploy the full application.

## Milestones:
M1: Domain Selection & Data Acquisition: Each mentee selects their X-ray domain and acquires the necessary dataset.
M2: Data Pipeline & Tokenizer Completion: Each mentee successfully builds and tests their domain-specific data pipeline.
M3: Transformer Model V1: Each mentee trains a version of the Transformer model on their dataset and generates initial reports.
M4: Website Integration & Deployment: The team successfully integrates all models into a single web application and deploys it.
